# Runners

#### Autonomous Delivery Bot Project

This is a ROS setup from a personal project for delivery robot that I was working on. The delivery robot, called a Runner, could navigate indoors and go between rooms in the building. But most of the time it was just a test mule for playing with planning algorithms.

The Runner consisted of a Kobuki base with a body mounted on the top, a compartment to store items, a Lidar unit inside (looking through the gap in the top), and an Android phone on top to issue commands through the screen.
