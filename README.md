#### Autonomous Delivery Bot Project

This is a ROS setup from a personal project for delivery robot that I was working on. It consisted of a Kobuki base with a body mounted on the top, a compartment to store items, and an Android phone on top to issue commands. 

The delivery robot, called a Runner, could navigate indoors and go between rooms in the building. But most of the time it was just a test mule for playing with planning algorithms.
